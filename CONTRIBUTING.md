# How to contribute

I'm glad you're interested in contributing to this library! Time does not currently allow for me to accept pull requests. My priorities for development are ranked as follows:

1. Fixing bugs
2. Improving the developer experience for existing features
3. New features

Please be patient and courteous. I created and contribute to this library outside of working hours, so my communications and contributions will almost always be limited to the evening (Central Standard Time, US).

## Roadmap

The library's [roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md) lists features and bug fixes which are currently prioritized.

## Discussion

This library uses [Github Discussions](https://github.com/thoughtful-web/settings-page-wp/discussions) to provide a space for users to ask questions and discuss the library. A code of conduct will be added soon.

## Issues

This library uses [Github Issues](https://github.com/thoughtful-web/settings-page-wp/issues) to manage bug reports. Before reporting a bug please search existing reports to see if there is an existing report you can contribute discussion to. If I am able to address an issue by modifying the documentation or the code then I will prioritise it. If an issue does not have an acceptance criteria that is achievable

Thank you!
