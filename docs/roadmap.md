# Roadmap

*[Home](../../README.md) / Roadmap*

These are bug fixes or enhancements I have thought about implementing. Bug fixes will be implemented and enhancements might be implemented.

1. Continue developing the documentation.
2. Create a form to generate a configuration file with.
3. Consider adding a network admin settings page configuration.
4. Consider adding a filter to the Select Field configuration to enable populating choices with data like:  
   a) Users  
   b) User Roles  
   c) Post Types  
   d) Taxonomies  
   e) Image Sizes  
5. Allow disabling or removing "choices" from Fields with the above value in case we need to scope access to updating these values. Perhaps this should be a filter for the configuration preprocessor.
6. Consider implementing a File field.
7. Check this plugin to see if we can scope admin-only actions within action hooks to minimize its impact on site performance.
